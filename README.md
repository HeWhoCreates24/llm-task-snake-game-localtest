# snake-game-localtest

**Round 2**

This app was generated by a tiny LLM-assisted generator (prompt recorded below) and deployed via GitHub Pages Actions.

## Brief
Make the theme dark and modern with gradient colors.

## How it works
- Static site in `dist/` is deployed by Actions.
- Attachments (if any) decoded from data URIs.
- Minimal JS implements checks.

## LLM prompt excerpt
You are an expert frontend engineer. Produce a single, self-contained HTML file (no external build step) that satisfies the brief below and passes basic selector checks. Follow these strict rules:

- Output ONLY raw HTML. Do not include markdown code fences.
- Use plain HTML/CSS/JS with CDN scripts when needed. No frameworks besides allowed CDNs.
- The page must be static and run fully in the browser.
- Use seed = tanmayhatkar when constructing any required element IDs.
- If attachments are referenced below, embed their content as base64 strings and decode in JS at runtime.

Brief: Make the theme dark and modern with gradient colors.
Task: snake-game-localtest

Attachments (name -> base64_sample):
{}

Implementation hints:
CHECK: background is dark themed
CHECK: snake is gradient colored, purple to blue
CHECK: fruits are randomly colored
CHECK: fruits are circular in shape
CHECK: fruits are distinguishable from the snake
CHECK: buttons are modern and minimalistic, with hover effects

Important:
- Include <!doctype html> and a <meta charset="utf-8">.
- Ensure the specified element IDs exist and are populated appropriately.
- If using external scripts: use jsDelivr for Bootstrap 5, marked, highlight.js, or Tesseract.js when applicable.
- Ensure the page remains functional without any server.
